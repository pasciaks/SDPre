Welcome to my Skill Distillery Pre-work repository. This repository contains the pre-work for the Skill Distillery Java bootcamp.  The pre-work is a series of assignments that are designed to get students familiar with the Java language and to prepare them for the course.

### Assignments and Related Files

- In addition to the assignments related to the Objectives, there are additional files and code here to make use of my prior knowledge.
- A .gitignore file is used to restrict publication of private folders/files to the public GitHub repository.
- A shell script is used to automate the compilation of .java files.

  - The script is called compile-labs.sh and is located in the root directory of this repository.  The script is run from the command line using the following command:

      ```bash
      ./compile-labs.sh
      ```

### Technologies Used

- Java
- Git
- GitHub
- Terminal
- Bash Shell Scripting / Zsh Shell Scripting
- Markdown
- Sublime Text
- IntelliJ IDEA
- Google Chrome
- Apple macOS
- Slack
- Zoom

### Java is a Compiled Language

- Java is a compiled language, which means that the source code is compiled into bytecode, which is then run on a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
- The JVM is a virtual machine that runs on your computer, and it's the engine that executes the bytecode.
- The JVM is different for each operating system, so Java bytecode is platform-independent.
- The JVM is responsible for translating the bytecode into instructions that can be understood by the underlying operating system.
- The JVM is responsible for memory management, garbage collection, and other system-level tasks.
- The JVM is responsible for translating the bytecode into instructions that can be understood by the underlying operating system.

### .java File

- A .java file consists of a single class definition.
- A .java file is compiled into a .class file.
- A .class file contains bytecode that is executed by the JVM.


### Java Class

- A Java class is a blueprint for creating objects.
- The class defines the properties and behaviors of the objects that are created from it.
- The public static void main method is the entry point for a Java application.

```java
public class Example {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello, World");
  }
}
```
